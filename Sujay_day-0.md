# Task 1

## Get a taste of other CFP products:

I looked at website called papercall.io .It is very similar to the current project.I has all the features which we are currently
implementing like having an individual profile, draft proposal and also speaker's info is invisible for organizer(organizer can 
choose the submissoin process to be anonymous.

YourCFP app would be differnt because:
- Organiser can search for speaker.
- A compulsory feedback system.
- A leaderboard.
