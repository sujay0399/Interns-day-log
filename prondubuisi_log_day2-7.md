In my one month internship I will be submitting per day log.


| Day Number  |  Planned Work | Delivered| Ticket |

| Day 1  | Setup repo for data collection, start data collection  | [repo](https://github.com/prondubuisi/societal-issues-stats)  | [Issue](https://github.com/prondubuisi/societal-issues-stats/issues)  |

## Things that made me stuck
Most data don't have API's
Can't find lots of data but I will keep searching
Yet to see the documents I should sign

## Things I liked putting work on 
Looking around the internet for data is helping me learn new things
